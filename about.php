                        Road accidents are an unfortunate reality of our lives. The daily news reports generally contain at
                        least
                        one incident of a road accident. Depending on the severity of the accident, the number of casualties and
                        the
                        damage done can be concerning. Road accidents cost a lot of lives and property damage. To avoid
                        accidents,
                        everyone should be more careful and vigilant on the streets. As a driver, one must be extra cautious
                        because
                        one mistake from the driver can cost the lives of innocent others.
                    </p>
                    <p>Through this project,we have created a database of records of Accidents in all the states of India.The
                        road
                        accidents database keeps a track of traffic accidents in a particular state and location. Each accident
                        has
                        an id (accident id) which is unique and simultaneously the date is also recorded. Number of Vehicles
                        participating in a specific accident are tracked and their id (vehicle id) is noted for
                        furtherconvenience.
                        In general, these vehicles can be car, bus, truck, two wheelers,etc. Weather conditions during road
                        mishap
                        are recorded along with time of accident. Fatalities involved with cars, jeeps, Buses, two wheelers
                        occur
                        mostly due to over speeding, head on collision and hit-run whereas those involved with trucks and heavy
                        Vehicles occur mostly due to goods overloading.

                            <h2>Every road accident has a cause which can be:</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li>OVER SPEEDING</li>

                    <p>An accident may have more than one cause. In Urban centres, the prime
                        reason for read accidents is distracted driving whereas in state and National
                        highways the prime reason is Over speeding and Collison.
                        In India, around 80% accidents are Hit and run and collisions. Further we can
                        subdivide Collisions as Head on collisions and Rear end collisions which lead to
                        death and major or minor injuries.</p>
                    <p>
                        In India, people mostly own two types of Vehicle Insurance:
                        a. Third party liability Insurance
                        b. Collision damage cover insurance
                        The current database also keeps a record of Vehicles participating in an
                        accident having any of the above insurance.
                        In recent years, the severity rate of accidents shows an increasing trend with
                        Tamilnadu having highest severity rate whereas Bihar with lowest severity
                        rate. Presently, vehicular population is growing at an annual rate of 10% and so
                        accident rate is expected to grow by 3-4 % annually.

                        THROUGH THIS PROJECT,WE HAVE TRIED TO CREATE A RELIABLE DATABASE ABOUT THE ACCIDENT RECORDS IN INDIA AND
                        WE HAVE ALSO HIGHLIGHTED THE IMPORTANCE OF USING PROTECTION EQUIPMENTS LIKE SEAT BELTS ,SAFETY HELMETS
                        TO REDUCE THE RISK OF LOSING LIVES IN ACCIDENTS.
